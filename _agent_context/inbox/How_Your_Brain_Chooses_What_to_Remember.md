[0:00] throughout our lives our brains face a
[0:02] constant challenge deciding which
[0:04] memories to keep and which to discard
[0:07] think about it you probably remember
[0:09] what you had for breakfast today but
[0:11] that memory will likely fade within
[0:13] months yet if you win a lottery today
[0:17] that memory would stay with you for the
[0:18] rest of your life this remarkable
[0:21] ability to distinguish between everyday
[0:23] moments and life-changing events reveals
[0:26] one of brain's most intriguing features
[0:29] a system for memory selection but how
[0:31] exactly does the brain make these
[0:33] crucial decisions and how does this
[0:35] selection take place Recent research has
[0:37] en failed An Elegant solution how a
[0:40] pattern of neural activity called a
[0:42] sharp wve Ripple acts as your brain's
[0:45] internal bookmarking system today we are
[0:48] exploring an Innovative study published
[0:50] in science earlier this year that shows
[0:52] how these events help tag important
[0:55] memories during the day and ensure they
[0:57] get properly stored while you sleep
[1:00] if you're interested stay
[1:02] [Music]
[1:10] tuned to solve this puzzle of memory
[1:13] selection we need to look deep inside
[1:15] the brain at a seahorse shaped structure
[1:17] called the
[1:18] hippocampus it plays a crucial role in
[1:21] episodic memory our ability to remember
[1:23] personal experiences as sequences of
[1:25] events in temporal order like
[1:28] remembering what happened this morning
[1:30] or on your first day at a new job what
[1:33] makes the hippocampus particularly
[1:34] intriguing is how it switches between
[1:36] two distinct
[1:38] modes during waking hours it diligently
[1:41] records experiences tracking where
[1:44] things happen and in what order it
[1:46] builds what's called a cognitive map a
[1:48] rich internal model of the environment
[1:50] and the events within it however during
[1:53] sleep when sensory inputs Qui down the
[1:56] hippocampus enters an offline mode where
[1:59] it replays specific experiences from the
[2:02] day this replay is accompanied by a
[2:05] distinctive pattern of brain activity
[2:07] called a sharp wve Ripple here is a way
[2:10] to think about it imagine a region of
[2:13] the hippocampus that spent the day
[2:15] building an updating its cognitive map
[2:18] during sleep at the onset of the replay
[2:20] event a massive wave of synchronized
[2:23] input arrives from Upstream hipocampal
[2:26] area triggering a so-called sharp wave
[2:30] this wave sweeps through the neural
[2:32] network like a tide and awakens
[2:34] countless previously quiet neurons but
[2:37] the brain is prepared for this surge it
[2:40] has safety mechanisms built into the
[2:42] circuit networks of inhibitory cells
[2:45] rapidly spring into action when activity
[2:47] Rises too high suppressing other neurons
[2:51] this creates a rapid back and forth
[2:53] between excitation and inhibition that
[2:55] appears as a highfrequency ripple riding
[2:58] on top of the sharp wave
[3:00] this choreography of neural activity
[3:02] serves a crucial purpose it creates a
[3:05] powerful selection mechanism for
[3:07] memories when the wave of excitation
[3:09] sweeps through the network it primes
[3:12] many neurons to fire yet they can't all
[3:16] fire at once the inhibitory interneurons
[3:19] act as Gatekeepers limiting overall
[3:22] activity and creating narrow Windows of
[3:24] opportunity brief moments when only
[3:27] selected groups of neurons can be active
[3:29] such interaction between excitation and
[3:32] inhibition sets up a form of competition
[3:34] in the neural
[3:35] network throughout the day our
[3:38] experiences have left their Mark by
[3:40] strengthening certain connections
[3:41] between neurons while leaving others
[3:43] unchanged or even weakening them some
[3:47] patterns of activity have become robust
[3:49] Pathways While others remain weak Trails
[3:52] when the wave of excitation arrives
[3:55] these different patterns each encoding a
[3:57] different memory compete for expression
[4:00] in this neural contest the strongest
[4:03] patterns typically win and remarkably
[4:06] these winning patterns that get to be
[4:08] replayed tend to represent the day's
[4:10] most significant events apart for
[4:13] competition such neural replays have
[4:15] another important feature they occur at
[4:18] a high speed like watching your days
[4:20] experiences on Fast Forward at the
[4:22] neural level what originally took
[4:26] seconds during Behavior gets compressed
[4:28] into around 100 milliseconds during
[4:31] sleep this temporal compression turns
[4:33] out to be absolutely crucial for memory
[4:36] storage you see during sleep the
[4:38] neocortex the outer layer of the brain
[4:41] enters a special state where it becomes
[4:44] receptive to signals from the
[4:46] hippocampus the compressed timing of
[4:48] these replays ensures that neural
[4:51] activity arrives in precise temporal
[4:53] Windows perfectly timed to strengthen
[4:56] connections between neurons in the
[4:58] neocortex
[4:59] through this process patterns encoding
[5:02] important events get repeatedly
[5:04] reactivated compressed and transferred
[5:07] into the CeX for permanent storage a
[5:09] process known as
[5:11] consolidation this raises an intriguing
[5:14] puzzle throughout the day countless
[5:16] experiences update the cognitive map but
[5:19] only some of them need to be preserved
[5:21] for later consolidation what does the
[5:24] hippocampus do with such patterns that
[5:26] somehow need to be preserved until sleep
[5:28] when the neocortex isn't yet ready to
[5:30] receive them this is where today's paper
[5:33] makes a crucial Discovery scientists had
[5:36] previously observed sharp wave Ripples
[5:38] and Associated replays during waking
[5:40] States particularly during brief periods
[5:43] of rest or immobility but these awake
[5:46] ripples were puzzling why would the
[5:48] brain replay memories when the near
[5:50] cortex isn't ready to store them and
[5:53] also the frequency with which such awake
[5:55] replays occur is much lower than in
[5:58] sleep which is probably insufficient as
[6:01] proper consolidation requires more
[6:03] repetitions it turns out that these
[6:06] awake replays serve as memory bookmarks
[6:09] when they occur right after important
[6:11] events they tag specific experiences for
[6:14] priority consolidation during
[6:17] sleep let's dive deeper into the paper
[6:19] to explore how exactly it was discovered
[6:22] but before we do that I'd like to
[6:23] mention that the authors of the paper
[6:25] also built an awesome interactive
[6:27] website and a collab notebook where you
[6:30] can play with the data and explore the
[6:32] plots on your
[6:34] own all right so to investigate the
[6:37] memory taging mechanism researchers
[6:39] needed a way to watch memories being
[6:41] formed tagged and Consolidated in real
[6:44] time they used An Elegant experiment
[6:46] with a simly simple task that would
[6:48] engage episodic memory their setup
[6:51] involved mice running through a figure
[6:53] eight maze with two identical arms each
[6:56] containing a potential reward site the
[6:59] challenge for the mice was to learn a
[7:01] specific strategy alternate between the
[7:03] arms to receive rewards if they found a
[7:06] reward on the left arm in one trial the
[7:09] next reward would be on the right by
[7:11] recording from hundreds of neurons in
[7:13] the hippocampus as mice ran through the
[7:15] maze over multiple days researchers
[7:18] could watch the learning process unfold
[7:20] each day mice would run trials sleep and
[7:24] return the next day to try again
[7:26] gradually getting better at the task but
[7:29] this race A new challenge how do you
[7:31] make sense of the activity patterns from
[7:33] hundreds of neurons when you recording
[7:35] from 400 neurons simultaneously each
[7:39] moment creates a complex Symphony of
[7:41] neural firing that is impossible to
[7:43] interpret by ey a popular approach in
[7:46] Neuroscience to make sense of such
[7:48] complex neural patterns is to look at
[7:50] the population activity and describe the
[7:53] collective behavior of cells in the
[7:56] network think about it this way at any
[7:58] given moment each neuron's activity
[8:00] level can be represented by a number how
[8:03] rapidly it is firing if you had just
[8:06] three numbers you could easily plot them
[8:08] in three-dimensional space with each
[8:10] number representing a position along X Y
[8:13] or Z axis but when instead of just three
[8:16] dimensions you have 400 it is impossible
[8:18] to visualize fortunately neurons don't
[8:21] act independently their activity is
[8:24] constrained by their connections and the
[8:26] inputs they receive meaning that the
[8:28] network can only generate certain
[8:31] patterns it's like a complex dance where
[8:34] dancers movements are coordinated while
[8:37] each dancer could theoretically move
[8:39] anywhere the choreography restricts them
[8:42] to specific patterns in terms of
[8:44] population activity this means that the
[8:46] brain's Dynamics is confined to a
[8:48] specific region in this vast 400
[8:51] dimensional space called a manifold but
[8:54] how can we describe this manifold in
[8:56] such a high dimensional space while
[8:59] while 400 coordinates might seem
[9:02] overwhelming the structured nature of
[9:04] neural Activity Works in our favor the
[9:07] patterns we observe can actually be
[9:09] described with far fewer numbers than
[9:12] 400 think of it like describing a curved
[9:15] line while it exists in 3D space with X
[9:18] Y and Z coordinates you really need just
[9:21] one number to specify where you are
[9:24] along the curve since the coordinates
[9:26] are related to each other by the
[9:28] equation the curve this Insight leads us
[9:32] to methods of dimensionality reduction
[9:34] techniques for finding simpler ways to
[9:36] describe complex patterns one
[9:39] particularly powerful method which is
[9:40] Central to this paper is called umap
[9:43] uniform manifold approximation and
[9:46] projection while the mathematical
[9:48] details are beyond the scope of this
[9:50] video the intuitive idea is quite simple
[9:53] U map searches for patterns of brain
[9:55] activity that cluster together first it
[9:58] identifies which patterns of activity
[10:00] are similar to each other in the
[10:01] original 400 dimensional space creating
[10:05] kind of a graph of neural activity
[10:07] relationships then it finds a way to
[10:09] preserve this graph structure while
[10:11] bringing the data down to just three
[10:13] dimensions that we can visualize it's
[10:15] like carefully unfolding a complex
[10:18] origami structure to reveal the flat
[10:20] paper underneath umap unwraps our neural
[10:23] manifold from 400 Dimensions to three
[10:27] exposing the hidden structure in the
[10:28] brain's activ ity
[10:31] patterns when applied to the hipocampal
[10:34] data umap reveals something remarkable a
[10:37] looped structure that perfectly mirrors
[10:39] the layout of the Figure 8 maze when we
[10:42] color each point based on where the
[10:44] animal was physically located in the
[10:46] Maze when that neural activity pattern
[10:49] occurred we see an exact
[10:52] correspondence what makes this
[10:53] particularly striking is that umab
[10:56] discovered the structure purely from
[10:58] neural activity without any information
[11:00] about the animal's actual position but
[11:03] the spal location is just one dimension
[11:06] of this task what about the animals
[11:08] learning progress across trials when we
[11:11] color the same points by trial number
[11:14] instead of position we see another layer
[11:16] of structure emerge changes that reflect
[11:20] the learning progression this means that
[11:23] the brain's activity patterns are
[11:24] changing in a systematic way as the
[11:27] animal gets better and better at the
[11:29] task creating a clear trajectory through
[11:32] this neural space this gives us a
[11:34] powerful tool we can now map any pattern
[11:37] of neural activity onto this maze
[11:39] manifold and determine whether it
[11:42] resembles actual task related activity
[11:45] if it does we can even try to identify
[11:48] which trial and position in the Maze it
[11:50] corresponds to as you might guess this
[11:53] becomes crucial for decoding what
[11:55] information gets replayed and
[11:58] consolidated during sharp wve
[12:01] ripples let's start with awake replays
[12:04] that occur when the animal pauses to
[12:06] consume the reward by projecting neural
[12:09] activity during these ripples onto the
[12:11] Learned maze manifold we can decode
[12:14] their content it's important to note
[12:16] that our umap structure was established
[12:19] purely from neural patterns during
[12:21] active maze running that's what shaped
[12:23] our
[12:24] manifold so when we find Ripple events
[12:27] that don't fall onto this manifold it
[12:30] doesn't necessarily mean they are random
[12:32] noise these off manifold events simply
[12:35] contain patterns that look completely
[12:38] different from anything um map saw
[12:40] during running Behavior they might
[12:42] represent other memories future planning
[12:44] or different cognitive processes we just
[12:47] can't decode their content because we
[12:49] lack the right reference frame many of
[12:52] the ripples however do nicely fall onto
[12:54] our maze manifold and they reveal
[12:57] something fascinating these events
[12:59] correspond to temporally compressed
[13:01] replays of the maze trajectory that just
[13:04] led to the reward because we can decode
[13:07] the trial number we can confirm that
[13:09] these replays specifically match the
[13:12] current trial the animal had just
[13:14] completed in other words awake replays
[13:17] capture recent memories of successful
[13:20] paths to the
[13:21] reward but what about the ripples during
[13:24] subsequent sleep while we can't know the
[13:27] animals true position or trial number
[13:29] number during sleep we can still decode
[13:31] Ripple content by mapping it onto our
[13:34] maze manifold remarkably the Sleep
[13:38] ripples that fall onto the manifold show
[13:40] striking similarities to the awake
[13:43] ripples they replay similar trials and
[13:46] Maze locations in contrast ripples
[13:49] recorded during sleep before the
[13:51] learning contain completely different
[13:53] patterns this reveals a crucial
[13:56] mechanism a wake ripples serve to taag
[13:59] specific events for later consolidation
[14:02] but why not consolidate memories
[14:04] immediately during these awake replays
[14:06] the answer lies in how memory
[14:08] consolidation works first the cortex
[14:11] needs to be in a specific brain state to
[14:14] receive information from the hippocampus
[14:16] a state that occurs only during sleep
[14:19] second a handful of replays isn't enough
[14:22] patterns need to be repeated multiple
[14:24] times to be properly transferred to
[14:27] cortical circuits during waking hours
[14:30] the hippocampus can't dedicate itself to
[14:33] endless replay it needs to keep tracking
[14:36] ongoing experiences and maintaining the
[14:38] cognitive map as the animal performs the
[14:41] task so here is the elegant solution the
[14:43] brain has evolved awake ripples identify
[14:47] and temporarily store important events
[14:49] in hipac cample circuits like
[14:51] bookmarking key pages in a book then
[14:54] during sleep when conditions are right
[14:56] for consolidation these bookmark pattern
[14:59] s get repeatedly reactivated and
[15:01] transferred to cortical networks for
[15:03] permanent storage while the exact
[15:05] cellular mechanisms of this bookmarking
[15:08] are still under investigation it is
[15:10] plausible that awake ripples trigger
[15:12] local synaptic plasticity within the
[15:14] hippocampus these changes might alter
[15:17] the Network's Dynamics in a way that
[15:19] makes C neural sequences more likely to
[15:21] reactivate during sleep ripples like
[15:24] carving out preferred paths in the
[15:26] landscape of possible activity patterns
[15:29] such two-stage process ensures that
[15:31] important memories get selected during
[15:34] wakefulness and properly Consolidated
[15:36] during sleep when the hippocampus can
[15:38] fully dedicate itself to the task of
[15:40] memory
[15:41] transfer these insights from hipocampal
[15:44] physiology highlight The crucial role of
[15:46] direct experience and practice in
[15:48] consolidating new information this
