## User Preferences

- Prefers decisions to be made directly. If the answer is obvious, do it and explain why. Don't ask for permission on clear choices.
- Wants rich, real content in context files. Template placeholders are explicitly called a "failure" in the initializer spec.
- Cares about the quality of the developer experience for the tool's end users. Every command interaction should feel crisp.
- Values keeping things simple: KISS, DRY, YAGNI are explicit principles in the SKILL.md.
- Prefers agents to edit files using native tools (Read/Edit/Write) for direct changes, and reserve the CLI for structural operations.
- **No em dashes** in writing. "Humans don't use these." Use commas, periods, or restructure the sentence instead.
- **No implementation details in user-facing copy.** Internal agent rules (like "~200 line limit") stay in soul/memory files, not in README or public docs.
- **Wants rich feature PRDs**, not bare task files. User stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, technical details, changelog. Full context for the agent when working on a feature.
- **Brand identity**: Company is "meansoft", product is "agentcontext". Keep them separate. Never mix the company name into the product CLI or docs.
- **UI brand palette**: Purple-to-magenta gradient: #641787, #781ca3, #8200a6, #db04b4. Font: Visby CF (commercial) with system font fallback. 4px grid. Light/dark mode with system preference detection.
- **Agent character**: User will provide custom design later. Current placeholder is the brand diamond logo.

## Communication Style

- Direct and technical. No over-explanation.
- When presenting options: max 2-3 choices, lead with the recommendation, one line per option.
- Concise progress updates. Don't narrate every step.
- Flag problems in one line and propose the fix. Don't apologize.

## Project Details

- **Repo**: `/Users/mehmetnuraydin/projects/agentcontext`
- **Package name**: `agentcontext` (npm)
- **Current version**: `0.1.0`
- **Binary**: `agentcontext` → `./dist/index.js`
- **Entry point**: `src/cli/index.ts` → compiled to `dist/index.js` via tsup
- **Test runner**: vitest
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/` — run directly against source, no build needed
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/` — run against `dist/index.js`, require `npm run build` first
- **Build**: `npm run build` (tsup, produces `dist/`)
- **Dev watch**: `npm run dev` (tsup --watch)
- **Publish**: `npm publish` (prepublishOnly runs build automatically)
- **Files shipped**: `dist/`, `skill/`, `agents/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`
- **Node requirement**: >= 18

## Project Rules

- **ESM everywhere**: `"type": "module"` in package.json. All TypeScript imports use `.js` extensions (even when importing `.ts` files). Never use `require()`.
- **Strict TypeScript**: `"strict": true` in tsconfig. No implicit any, no unused locals.
- **No default exports for lib files**: Named exports only in `src/lib/`. Default exports only where a framework requires it (e.g., tsup config).
- **Register pattern**: Every command module exports a `registerXyzCommand(program: Command)` function. Registered in `src/cli/index.ts`.
- **Template tokens**: Use `{{TOKEN_NAME}}` format (uppercase). Defined in `init.ts` `tokens` object.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for source files, matching Commander command names where applicable.
- **Commit messages**: Conventional commits format (feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, test). Co-Authored-By footer for AI commits.
- **No `.claude/` in this repo**: The skill/agents are for distribution only. They get installed into consuming projects via `agentcontext install-skill`.

## Skills & Capabilities

- TypeScript, Node.js ecosystem, ESM modules
- Commander.js for CLI argument parsing
- @inquirer/prompts for interactive prompts
- gray-matter for YAML frontmatter parsing/writing
- fast-glob for file system glob patterns
- nanoid for unique ID generation
- chalk for terminal color output
- tsup (esbuild-based) for TypeScript bundling
- vitest for unit and integration testing

## Workflow Notes

- **Always run tests** (`npm test`) before considering any change complete.
- Build before running integration tests: `npm run build && npm test`
- When changing a template file under `src/templates/`, the templates are copied to `dist/templates` on build. Changes won't affect integration tests until rebuilt.
- The `skill/SKILL.md` and `agents/*.md` files are the source of truth for the Claude Code integration. They are bundled into the npm package and distributed to end users.
- Publishing: `npm publish` triggers `prepublishOnly` → `npm run build` → publishes `dist/`, `skill/`, `agents/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`.
- The `.npmignore` controls what is excluded from the npm package (source files, tests, config files).
