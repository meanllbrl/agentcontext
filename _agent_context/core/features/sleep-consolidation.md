## Why

Agents accumulate knowledge and make decisions across many sessions, but that knowledge degrades or gets lost without a structured consolidation process. Sleep consolidation — modeled on REM sleep — automatically tracks how much work has accumulated and triggers a dedicated sub-agent to fold learnings into the core context files before the brain gets overloaded.

## User Stories

- [x] As an AI agent, I want sleep debt tracked automatically so I don't have to manually decide when to consolidate.
- [x] As an AI agent, I want to see the current sleep debt level at session start so I know whether to consolidate before doing more work.
- [x] As an AI agent, I want graduated awareness thresholds (Alert / Drowsy / Sleepy / Must Sleep) so the urgency of consolidation is unambiguous.
- [x] As an AI agent, I want the Stop hook to record each session's transcript path and last assistant message so the consolidation agent has the raw material it needs.
- [x] As an AI agent, I want the SessionStart hook to auto-analyze any unanalyzed sessions so debt scoring happens even if the Stop hook missed a session.
- [x] As a developer, I want to manually add debt for non-file-change work (architecture discussions, decisions) so the debt meter reflects cognitive load accurately.
- [x] As a developer, I want to reset debt after consolidation with a summary so the system knows when the last sleep happened.
- [x] As an AI agent, I want a dedicated REM Sleep sub-agent to do the consolidation so the main agent can stay focused on the user's task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `hook stop` reads session_id, transcript_path, and last_assistant_message from stdin JSON; analyzes transcript for Write/Edit tool uses; stores session record in `state/.sleep.json`.
- `hook session-start` finds all sessions with `score: null` and analyzes their transcripts; adds computed scores to debt total.
- Debt scoring: session score = `Math.max(scoreFromChangeCount, scoreFromToolCount)`. `scoreFromChangeCount`: 0=0, 1-3=+1, 4-8=+2, 9+=+3. `scoreFromToolCount`: 0=0, 1-15=+1, 16-40=+2, 41+=+3.
- Debt levels: 0-3 = Alert, 4-6 = Drowsy, 7-9 = Sleepy, 10+ = Must Sleep.
- `hook session-start` prepends a CRITICAL consolidation directive to the snapshot output when debt >= 10.
- `hook session-start` prepends a softer advisory note when debt >= 7.
- `sleep status` shows current debt, level, last sleep date, and per-session history.
- `sleep add <score> <description>` manually records a debt entry (scores 1-3 only).
- `sleep done <summary>` resets debt to 0, records last_sleep date, clears sessions array.
- `sleep debt` outputs the raw debt number for programmatic use.
- If the same session_id stops twice, the old score is subtracted before the new score is added (no double-counting).
- Transcripts over 50MB are skipped (safety cap).

## Constraints & Decisions

- **[2026-02-27]** Bookmarks (awake ripples) are now the primary consolidation signal. Critical (salience 3) bookmarks trigger the consolidation advisory regardless of debt level. The rem-sleep agent processes bookmarks first.
- **[2026-02-27]** `freshDefaults()` replaces `DEFAULT_SLEEP_STATE` spread everywhere. Spreading a const with arrays shares references across calls -- this caused test pollution. Always call `freshDefaults()` when initializing an empty SleepState.
- **[2026-02-27]** Trigger `fired_count` is persisted by `writeSleepState()` inside `generateSnapshot()`. Triggers expire (removed from state) in `sleep done` after hitting `max_fires`. This is intentional -- persistent triggers that always fire become noise.
- **[2026-02-27]** Transcript distillation is pure Node.js structural filtering, no AI. Keeps user messages, agent text (>20 chars), Write/Edit calls, modifying Bash, bookmark calls, errors. Discards Read/Glob/Grep/WebFetch results, tool metadata, subagent internals.
- **[2026-02-25]** Debt is tracked in `state/.sleep.json` (dot-prefixed to separate it from user task files in `state/`).
- **[2026-02-25]** Transcript analysis is regex-based (`/"name"\s*:\s*"(?:Write|Edit)"/g`), not a full JSON parse, for performance on large JSONL files.
- **[2026-02-25]** The consolidation itself is done by the `agentcontext-rem-sleep` sub-agent, not by the CLI. The CLI only tracks debt; the agent dispatches the sub-agent when needed.
- **[2026-02-25]** Sessions array is LIFO (newest first) -- the most recent session is at index 0.

**Hook flow**:
1. Session ends → Claude Code fires Stop hook → `hook stop` reads stdin JSON, analyzes transcript, prepends session record to `sessions[]`, adds score to `debt`, writes state.
2. Next session starts → Claude Code fires SessionStart hook → `hook session-start` finds sessions with `score: null`, analyzes their transcripts, updates scores and debt. Then generates and outputs the snapshot with any consolidation directive prepended.

**Scoring function** (`src/cli/commands/hook.ts`): `Math.max(scoreFromChangeCount, scoreFromToolCount)`

`scoreFromChangeCount` (Write/Edit tool calls):
- 0 changes → 0
- 1-3 changes → +1 (light session)
- 4-8 changes → +2 (moderate session)
- 9+ changes → +3 (heavy session)

`scoreFromToolCount` (all tool calls — catches Bash-heavy sessions with no file writes):
- 0 tools → 0
- 1-15 tools → +1
- 16-40 tools → +2
- 41+ tools → +3

**Key files**:
- `src/cli/commands/hook.ts` — hook stop, hook session-start, transcript analysis, debt scoring, bookmark linking, rhythm counter
- `src/cli/commands/sleep.ts` — sleep status, sleep add, sleep done, sleep debt, sleep history, SleepState type (Bookmark, Trigger, SleepHistoryEntry, KnowledgeAccessRecord), readSleepState/writeSleepState, freshDefaults()
- `src/cli/commands/bookmark.ts` — bookmark add/list/clear
- `src/cli/commands/trigger.ts` — trigger add/list/remove
- `src/cli/commands/transcript.ts` — transcript distill (structural JSONL filter)
- `src/cli/commands/snapshot.ts` — bookmarks section, warm knowledge tier, contextual reminders, sleep history in output, extractFirstParagraph(), trigger matching + fired_count persistence
- `agents/agentcontext-rem-sleep.md` — the REM sleep consolidation sub-agent instructions (bookmark-first processing, transcript distillation, trigger creation, access-based anti-bloat)
- `_agent_context/core/6.system_flow.md` — complete system lifecycle and data flow documentation

**REM Sleep agent protocol**: When dispatched, the agent reads the brief from the main agent, reads session records from `.sleep.json` (using `last_assistant_message` as primary input), determines what files to update, executes updates (soul, user, memory, changelog, task logs, feature PRDs), then calls `agentcontext sleep done "<summary>"` to reset debt.

## Notes

- The Stop hook does not block the session from ending — it has a 5-second timeout. If it fails silently, the SessionStart hook catches up by re-analyzing the transcript.
- The `last_assistant_message` field from the Stop hook is the single most valuable piece of data for the REM sleep agent — it contains Claude's summary of what was accomplished, making transcript reads optional in most cases.
- Manual debt entries (`sleep add`) use a `manual-<timestamp>` session_id and `transcript_path: null`. They will never be re-analyzed by the SessionStart hook.
- The REM sleep agent calls `sleep done` itself after consolidation — the main agent should not call it.
