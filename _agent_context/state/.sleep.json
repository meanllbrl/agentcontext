The epoch-based filtering at `src/cli/commands/sleep.ts:223-236` applies the same `> epoch` comparison to both arrays:\n\n- **Sessions**: `state.sessions.filter(s => s.stopped_at > epoch)`\n- **Dashboard changes**: `state.dashboard_changes.filter(c => c.timestamp > epoch)`\n\nEvery dashboard change gets a mandatory `timestamp` when recorded in `change-tracker.ts:110`. So if another session logs a dashboard change while rem-sleep is running, it will have a post-epoch timestamp and survive the `sleep done` clearing.\n\nThe backward-compat path (when `sleep_started_at` is `null`) clears both arrays entirely, which is the expected fallback.\n\nIntegration tests at `tests/integration/sleep.test.ts:225-247` explicitly verify that post-epoch dashboard changes are preserved.
