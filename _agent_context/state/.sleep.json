Here's what changed:\n\n**Extracted `sleep_history` to `_agent_context/state/.sleep-history.json`:**\n\n- Removed `sleep_history` from `SleepState` interface and `freshDefaults()`\n- Added `readSleepHistory()` and `writeSleepHistory()` using `readJsonArray`/`writeJsonArray`\n- Added auto-migration: if `.sleep.json` still contains `sleep_history`, `readSleepState()` moves it to the new file and strips it from `.sleep.json`\n- Updated `sleep done` to write history entries to the separate file\n- Updated `sleep history` subcommand to read from the separate file\n- Updated `snapshot.ts` to read history from the separate file\n- Updated tests (4 history tests pass, migration test added, removed `sleep_history` from `SleepState` expectations)\n- Updated `6.system_flow.md` with new file path and schema\n\nAll 386 tests passing. The existing history data was migrated on first run.",
